## About the Project
Welcome to **Fork & Focus**, where you'll find intriguing and insightful blog posts about the latest restaurants that we recommend all across the world.

This project is a culmination of my work during the first year of the Front-end Development program at Noroff (FED1). As part of the project, I was tasked with building a front-end user interface for an existing API-based blogging platform. The client requested a responsive application that allows users to easily browse dynamic blog content. Additionally, admin features were implemented, enabling user registration, login, and blog post management.

## Features

- View Posts: All users can browse blog posts without the need to log in.
- User Authentication: Users can register and log in.
- Create Posts: Logged-in users can create and publish new blog posts.
- Edit Posts: Users with access can modify their previously published posts.
- Delete Posts: Logged-in users have the ability to remove their own posts.
- Category Filtering: Users can filter blog posts based on specific categories.
- Search Functionality: A keyword search allows users to quickly find relevant blog posts.

#### Info on the client:
- Name: Fork & Focus
- Sector: Restaurant and food industry
- Size: 5+ Employees
- Location: Worldwide
- Goal: Give the latest insights into amazing restaurants and dining across the world.

My goal was to design a clean and straightforward webpage that aligns with the clientâ€™s identity and industry. The blue theme was chosen to represent integrity, responsibility, and professionalism I aimed to associate with Fork & Focus and present to its audience.

#### Admin Login Details:

Available upon request.
